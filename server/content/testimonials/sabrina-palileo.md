  The food is great and the staff are very friendly and accommodating. The
  ambience of the bar itself is very chill so it’s a nice place to hang out. The
  location is also not in a very busy area  that I can enjoy a quiet drink. They
  are also having live bands these days so it’s really a great bar to grab a
  drink.
